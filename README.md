# Address Book Challenge

## Built using: ##

- Node.js as the main Javascript framework
- React for the front end and automatic re-rendering when data is inserted
- Express for routing and hosting the Node.js server
- REST Extension in VSCode to test database queries
- MongoDB database to store the Addresses

To run the code you'll need a mongoDB server instance running.

You'll need to run the following lines on a terminal with node.js installed:

- npm install express
- npm install mongoose
- npm install react
- npx create-react-app

and to run the express server:

> npm run runDev

and to run the react front end:

> npm run start
